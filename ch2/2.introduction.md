## Introduction

Human activity, primarily fossil fuel burning, is increasing atmospheric [CO~2~] and raising global mean temperature [@Hartmann:2013jv]. These changes are likely to have direct and indirect effects on storage of soil organic carbon (SOC), but estimates of the direction and magnitude of these effects are poorly constrained [@Dieleman:2012gm; @Lu:2013gu]. Soils worldwide store over two orders of magnitude more C than annual anthropogenic emissions [$\approx$ 1500 Pg C in the top 1 m; @Eswaran:1993ip], so even small changes in soil C storage in response to climate change could produce large feedbacks to the global C cycle. This may be especially true of the SOC-rich former prairie soils of the agriculturally managed Midwestern United States, where annual tillage, infrequent water limitation, regular fertilization, and frequent pulses of highly labile C from crop residues provide ideal conditions for temperature-controlled microbial activity [@Tisdall:1980ug].

Changes in soil C are difficult to detect on short timescales because some pools turn over slowly, with mean residence times of hundreds of years. Although it is conceptually useful to identify the faster-cycling subpools of soil C, we lack experimental methods to measure them directly [@Schmidt:2011gg]. Instead, changes in the rate of CO~2~ fluxes from soil can be used as a proxy for changes in the soil C cycle by partitioning total CO~2~ flux (R~tot~) into components attributed to "autotrophic" respiration (R~aut~) from plant roots and rhizosphere organisms, or to "heterotrophic" respiration (R~het~) from soil microbes in the process of breaking down soil organic matter (SOM). Because R~het~ is the primary avenue for loss of soil C, any change in R~het~ indicates a change in the rate of soil C loss. R~het~ is strongly controlled by soil temperature and moisture and therefore expected to shift under future climate conditions [@Davidson:2006bn; @Subke:2010eb; @Conant:2011hd; @Bradford:2013ir]. In contrast, changes in R~aut~ are indirectly linked to the rate of C *input* from roots, so a unit change in R~tot~ could indicate either increasing or decreasing soil C. Therefore correct partitioning of fluxes is essential to their use as a proxy for changes in pool size [@kuzyakov:2005fr].

Previous soil heating experiments have generally shown short-term increases in R~tot~ [@Rustad:2001kx; @Wu:2011jc], except when heating exacerbated soil water limitations [@Schindlbacher:2012gu; @Pendall:2013fj; @Wang:2014gv; @Suseela:2013bw; @Wall:2013ej]. This heating effect often diminishes after a few years of treatment. Whether these responses will persist over the long term under climate change depends on whether a particular soil's R~het~ response is modulated by availability of nutrients or C substrates [@Chevallier:2015tw; @Luo:2001cu] or by physiological adaptation of the microbial community [@Allison:2010p5325; @Bradford:2013ir]. In addition, few of these studies were able to separate soil respiration into its autotrophic and heterotrophic components. Since R~het~ is strongly controlled by thermal kinetics while R~aut~ responds to a wide variety of non-thermal factors, it has been widely assumed that temperature-associated increases in R~tot~ are driven by increasing R~het~, but support for this assumption is equivocal [@Hartley:2007fp; @BondLamberty:2010p4847; @Suseela:2013bw; @Wang:2014gv].

Previous CO~2~ enrichment experiments have generally shown sustained increases in R~tot~ [@Bernhardt:2006jm; @Drake:2011p6358; @Carrillo:2011er; @Pregitzer:2006eq; @Adair:2011bm; @Peralta:2008p4145; @King:2004io; @Keidel:2015dx], but there are few reported results from field experiments that manipulate both heat and CO~2~ simultaneously. Of those that are reported [@Carrillo:2011er; @Pendall:2011fa; @Selsted:2012ih; @Pendall:2013fj], the observed responses seem to be mostly mediated by water availability, with heat increasing R~tot~ when moisture is available and reducing it when heating produces drier soil. Elevated CO~2~ mediates these effects by ameliorating soil water stress through increased plant water use efficiency, but the strength and predictability of this effect seems to vary widely both within and between experiments.

The objective of this study was to measure the root- and SOM-derived components of soil respiration in an intact maize-soybean ecosystem subjected to mid-21^st^ century temperature (+3.5 Â°C) and CO~2~ (585 ppm) conditions under fully open-air conditions at SoyFACE (Urbana IL, USA). We then used a process-based biogeochemical model [DayCent; @Parton:1998p1616] to predict the long-term effects of these respiratory responses on soil C storage. We predicted that elevated temperature would increase the activity of soil heterotrophs, leading to increased respiration in root-free soil and long-term losses of C from the most labile pools of SOM. We further predicted that elevated CO~2~ would increase plant biomass above and belowground, leading to higher C inputs that would at least partially ameliorate the long-term effect of heat on soil C, and therefore that the long-term fate of soil C at our site would depend on the strength of the interaction between heat and CO~2~ effects.
