## Tables and Figures

Table: Mixed effects model results for rates of soil CO~2~ efflux attributed to soil heterotrophs (R~het~), plant roots and rhizosphere organisms (R~aut~), and whole soil (R~tot~). The first six columns show P values for each effect. Boldface values are significant at a preselected threshold of 0.1. The main Day effect was always significant (all P < 0.02) and is not shown here to save space. The last two columns show percent change from control for each treatment, presented as the estimated differences ± 1 standard error of whole-season LS means. {#tbl:obsrespstat}
