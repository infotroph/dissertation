## Supplement 2.S1: DayCent model fit evaluation

### Data availability

All the data for this paper, including raw files, data-processing scripts, and DayCent simulation files, is permanantly archived in Dryad (http://datadryad.org) and is freely available online: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bn7j3.

Additionally, the DayCent model files, raw output, run management scripts and the majority of the model calibration data are available online at https://github.com/infotroph/soyface_daycent. Some validation was performed against unpublished datasets that were shared by collaborators in advance of publication; these are not available in this project's archive, but we intend to update the Github repository with links to those datasets at such time as their authors make them available.

^1^R = randomized weather; H = historic weather from Illinois Water Survey (4.7 km from site); D = Gridded weather for site retrieved from DAYMET.

^2^M = Moldboard plow; D = disk; C = Chisel plow.

^3^Fertilization rates are in kg N ha^-1^. Fertilizer is applied before planting of maize and wheat only; other crops are never fertilized.

^1^These cultivar names come from a set of 11 developed by Hudiburg et al. [-@Hudiburg:2014gv]; C2, C4, C6, C8, C11 are not shown here because they were not used in the current simulations.

^2^These parameters are ignored by DayCent when FRTINDX==2, as it is for all of these cultivars, and are included here only for completeness.
