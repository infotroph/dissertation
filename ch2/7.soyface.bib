abstract = {Extensive evidence shows that increasing CO2 concentration ([CO2]) stimulates, and increasing temperature decreases, both net photosynthetic carbon assimilation (A) and biomass production for C3 plants. A [CO2]-induced stimulation in A is projected to increase further with higher temperature. While the influence of increasing temperature and [CO2] on A and biomass production have been widely investigated, the interaction between these two major global changes have not been tested on field-grown crops. Here, the interactive effect of both elevated [CO2] (~585 ppm) and temperature (+3.5 $\,^{\circ}$C) on soybean (Glycine max Merr.) A, biomass, and yield were tested over two growing seasons in the Temperature by Free-Air CO2 Enrichment experiment at the Soybean Free Air CO2 Enrichment facility. Measurements of A, stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular [CO2] (Ci) and quantum yield of photosystem II (ФPSII) were collected along with meteorological, water potential, and growth data. Elevated temperatures caused lower A, which was largely attributed to declines in gs, Ci, and ФPSII and led in turn to lower yields. Increasing both [CO2] and temperature stimulated A on only two sampling days during 2009 and on no days in 2011. The potential for stomatal acclimation was also investigated demonstrating that gs did not acclimate to elevated [CO2], but did acclimate to increased temperature. These results provide a better understanding of the physiological responses and mechanisms involved for soybean under future climate change conditions and suggest that the potential is limited for elevated [CO2] to mitigate the influence of rising temperatures on photosynthesis, growth, and yields of C3 crops.},

abstract = {It is unclear how changing atmospheric composition will influence the plant-soil interactions that determine soil organic matter (SOM) levels in fertile agricultural soils. Positive effects of CO2 fertilization on plant productivity and residue returns should increase SOM stocks unless mineralization or biomass removal rates increase in proportion to offset gains. Our objectives were to quantify changes in SOM stocks and labile fractions in prime farmland supporting a conventionally managed corn-soybean system and the seasonal dynamics of labile C and N in soybean in plots exposed to elevated [CO2] (550 ppm) under free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) conditions. Changes in SOM stocks including reduced C/N ratios and labile N stocks suggest that SOM declined slightly and became more decomposed in all plots after 3 years. Plant available N (> 273 mg N kg(-1)) and other nutrients (Bray P, 22-50 ppm; extractable K, 157-237 ppm; Ca, 2,378-2,730 ppm; Mg, 245-317 ppm) were in the high to medium range. Exposure to elevated [CO2] failed to increase particulate organic matter C (POM-C) and increased POM-N concentrations slightly in the surface depth despite known increases (approximate to 30%) in root biomass. This, and elevated CO2 efflux rates indicate accelerated decay rates in fumigated plots (2001: elevated [CO2]: 10.5 +/- 1.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) vs. ambient: 8.9 +/- 1.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). There were no treatment-based differences in the within-season dynamics of SOM. Soil POM-C and POM-N contents were slightly greater in the surface depth of elevated than ambient plots. Most studies attribute limited ability of fumigated soils to accumulate SOM to N limitation and/or limited plant response to CO2 fertilization. In this study, SOM turnover appears to be accelerated under elevated [CO2] even though soil moisture and nutrients are non-limiting and plant productivity is consistently increased. Accelerated SOM turnover rates may have long-term implications for soil's productive potential and calls for deeper investigation into C and N dynamics in highly-productive row crop systems.},

abstract = {Responses of soil respiration to atmospheric and climatic change will have profound impacts on ecosystem and global carbon (C) cycling in the future. This study was conducted to examine effects on soil respiration of the concurrent driving factors of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, air warming, and changing precipitation in a constructed old-field grassland in eastern Tennessee, USA. Model ecosystems of seven old-field species were established in open-top chambers and treated with factorial combinations of ambient or elevated (+300 ppm) CO2 concentration, ambient or elevated (+3 $\,^\circ$C) air temperature, and high or low soil moisture content. During the 19-month experimental period from June 2003 to December 2004, higher CO2 concentration and soil water availability significantly increased mean soil respiration by 35.8% and 15.7%, respectively. The effects of air warming on soil respiration varied seasonally from small reductions to significant increases to no response, and there was no significant main effect. In the wet side of elevated CO2 chambers, air warming consistently caused increases in soil respiration, whereas in the other three combinations of CO2 and water treatments, warming tended to decrease soil respiration over the growing season but increase it over the winter. There were no interactive effects on soil respiration among any two or three treatment factors irrespective of time period. Treatment-induced changes in soil temperature and moisture together explained 49%, 44%, and 56% of the seasonal variations of soil respiration responses to elevated CO2, air warming, and changing precipitation, respectively. Additional indirect effects of seasonal dynamics and responses of plant growth on C substrate supply were indicated. Given the importance of indirect effects of the forcing factors and plant community dynamics on soil temperature, moisture, and C substrate, soil respiration response to climatic warming should not be represented in models as a simple temperature response function, and a more mechanistic representation including vegetation dynamics and substrate supply is needed.},

abstract = {Temperature regulates the rate of biogeochemical cycles. One way it does so is through control of microbial metabolism. Warming effects on metabolism change with time as physiology adjusts to the new temperature. I here propose that such thermal adaptation is observed in soil microbial respiration and growth, as the result of universal evolutionary trade-offs between the structure and function of both enzymes and membranes. I review the basis for these trade-offs and show that they, like substrate depletion, are plausible mechanisms explaining soil respiration responses to warming. I argue that controversies over whether soil microbes adapt to warming stem from disregarding the evolutionary physiology of cellular metabolism, and confusion arising from the term thermal acclimation to represent phenomena at the organism- and ecosystem-levels with different underlying mechanisms. Measurable physiological adjustments of the soil microbial biomass reflect shifts from colder- to warmer-adapted taxa. Hypothesized declines in the growth efficiency of soil microbial biomass under warming are controversial given limited data and a weak theoretical basis. I suggest that energy spilling (aka waste metabolism) is a more plausible mechanism for efficiency declines than the commonly invoked increase in maintenance-energy demands. Energy spilling has many fitness benefits for microbes and its response to climate warming is uncertain. Modeled responses of soil carbon to warming are sensitive to microbial growth efficiency, but declines in efficiency mitigate warming-induced carbon losses in microbial models and exacerbate them in conventional models. Both modeling structures assume that microbes regulate soil carbon turnover, highlighting the need for a third structure where microbes are not regulators. I conclude that microbial physiology must be considered if we are to have confidence in projected feedbacks between soil carbon stocks, atmospheric CO2, and climate change.},

abstract = {The recovery of ecosystem C and N dynamics after disturbance can be a slow process. Chronosequence approaches offer unique opportunities to use space-for-time substitution to quantify the recovery of ecosystem C and N stocks and estimate the potential of restoration practices for C sequestration. We studied the distribution of C and N stocks in two chronosequences that included long-term cultivated lands, 3- to 26-year-old prairie restorations, and remnant prairie on two related soil series. Results from the two chronosequences did not vary significantly and were combined. Based on modeling predictions, the recovery rates of different ecosystem components varied greatly. Overall, C stocks recovered faster than N stocks, but both C and N stocks recovered more rapidly for aboveground vegetation than for any other ecosystem component. Aboveground C and N reached 95% of remnant levels in only 13 years and 21 years, respectively, after planting to native vegetation. Belowground plant C and N recovered several decades later, while microbial biomass C, soil organic C (SOC), and total soil N recovered on a century timescale. In the cultivated fields, SOC concentrations were depleted within the surface 25 cm, coinciding with the depth of plowing, but cultivation apparently led to redistribution of soil C, increasing SOC stocks deeper in the soil profile. The restoration of prairie vegetation was effective at rebuilding soil organic matter (SOM) in the surface soil. Accrual rates were maintained at 43 g C x m(-2) x yr(-1) and 3 g N x m(-2) x yr(-1) in the surface 0.16 Mg/m2 soil mass during the first 26 years of restoration and were predicted to reach 50% of their storage potential (3500 g C/m2) in the first 100 years. We conclude that restoration of tallgrass prairie vegetation can restore SOM lost through cultivation and has the potential to sequester relatively large amounts of SOC over a sustained period of time. Whether restored prairies can retain the C apparently transferred to the subsoil by cultivation practices remains to be seen.},

abstract = {The C-4 grass Zea mays (maize or corn) is the third most important food crop globally in terms of production and demand is predicted to increase 45% from 1997 to 2020. However, the effects of rising [CO2] upon C-4 plants, and Z. mays specifically, are not sufficiently understood to allow accurate predictions of future crop production. A rainfed, field experiment utilizing free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) technology in the primary area of global corn production (US Corn Belt) was undertaken to determine the effects of elevated [CO2] on corn. FACE technology allows experimental treatments to be imposed upon a complete soil-plant-atmosphere continuum with none of the effects of experimental enclosures on plant microclimate. Crop performance was compared at ambient [CO2] (354 mu mol mol(-1)) and the elevated [CO2] (549 mumol mol(-1)) predicted for 2050. Previous laboratory studies suggest that under favorable growing conditions C-4 photosynthesis is not typically enhanced by elevated [CO2]. However, stomatal conductance and transpiration are decreased, which can indirectly increase photosynthesis in dry climates. Given the deep soils and relatively high rainfall of the US Corn Belt, it was predicted that photosynthesis would not be enhanced by elevated [CO2]. The diurnal course of gas exchange of upper canopy leaves was measured in situ across the growing season of 2002. Contrary to the prediction, growth at elevated [CO2] significantly increased leaf photosynthetic CO2 uptake rate (A) by up to 41%, and 10% on average. Greater A was associated with greater intercellular [CO2], lower stomatal conductance and lower transpiration. Summer rainfall during 2002 was very close to the 50-year average for this site, indicating that the year was not atypical or a drought year. The results call for a reassessment of the established view that C-4 photosynthesis is insensitive to elevated [CO2] under favorable growing conditions and that the production potential of corn in the US Corn Belt will not be affected by the global rise in [CO2].},

abstract = {Soil respiration, R-S, the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO2) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux(1-3). However, the dynamics of R-S are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained(4,5). Ecosystem warming experiments(6,7), modelling analyses(8,9) and fundamental biokinetics(10) all suggest that R-S should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R-S, inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R-S on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R-S values in the extant four-decade record of R-S chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R-S observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R-S record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO2 measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R-S. We estimate that the global R-S in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R-S response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R-S value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

abstract = {While increasing temperatures and altered soil moisture arising from climate change in the next 50 years are projected to decrease yield of food crops, elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) is predicted to enhance yield and offset these detrimental factors. However, C4 photosynthesis is usually saturated at current [CO2] and theoretically should not be stimulated under elevated [CO2]. Nevertheless, some controlled environment studies have reported direct stimulation of C4 photosynthesis and productivity, as well as physiological acclimation, under elevated [CO2]. To test if these effects occur in the open air and within the Corn Belt, maize (Zea mays) was grown in ambient [CO2] (376 $\mu$mol mol−1) and elevated [CO2] (550 $\mu$mol mol−1) using Free-Air Concentration Enrichment technology. The 2004 season had ideal growing conditions in which the crop did not experience water stress. In the absence of water stress, growth at elevated [CO2] did not stimulate photosynthesis, biomass, or yield. Nor was there any CO2 effect on the activity of key photosynthetic enzymes, or metabolic markers of carbon and nitrogen status. Stomatal conductance was lower (−34%) and soil moisture was higher (up to 31%), consistent with reduced crop water use. The results provide unique field evidence that photosynthesis and production of maize may be unaffected by rising [CO2] in the absence of drought. This suggests that rising [CO2] may not provide the full dividend to North American maize production anticipated in projections of future global food supply.},

While the species distributions and frequency differed, the number of species measured per 1 m(2) quadrat were not significantly different (15.8 +/- 4.4 and 14.1 +/- 2.1 for remnant and planted [order for all reported values in abstract]; P=0.29), and the annual average aboveground net primary productivity (271 +/- 51 and 330 +/- 55 g C m(-2)) and peak leaf area index (2.9-4.9 m(2) m(-2)) were comparable under similar fire management. Total root biomass was not significantly different in 2002 (1736 +/- 1062 and 1690 +/- 459 g dry matter m(-2)) or 2003 (3029 +/- 2081 and 2146 +/- 898 g m(-2)), but annual average soil respiration (1229 +/- 77 and 1428 +/- 24 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) was significantly higher in the restoration (P < 0.0001). However, the prairie remnant contained 37% greater soil C (P < 0.0001) in the top 25 cm. Soil respiration response to 10 cm soil temperature (Q(10)) varied with respect to prairie and soil moisture conditions as annual Q(10) values ranged from 2.5 to 3.6. We calculated a range of net ecosystem production (NEP) values using estimated heterotrophic respiration and three root turnover values. Average NEP varied from -1.4 to 1.9 and -2.3 to 1.3 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) for the remnant and planted prairies, respectively. While these two prairies share similar structural components and functional attributes, the large uncertainty in NEP casts doubt as to whether we can verify these prairies as C sources or sinks without direct measures of heterotrophic respiration and root turnover. We argue that quantitative studies of C exchange in prairies, which differ in restoration methodology, management intensity, and fire frequency, are needed to solidify the relationship between prairie structure and potentially desired functions such as C sequestration.},

The theoretical and practical aspects of this design are described, with emphasis on the fluid mechanics of air-CO2 mixing in sonic jets. Field performance data, including spectral analysis of short-term fluctuations in CO2 concentrations as well as temporal and spatial CO2 control, are reported for the European project POPFACE facility.Temporal and spatial performances of the operational POPFACE systems were adequate with average long-term CO2 mole fractions on target. Averages over 1 min measured in the centre of the rings were within +/-20% and +/-10% of the target concentration for > 91% and > 75% of the time, respectively.The data presented provide convincing evidence that a pure-CO2 FACE system can achieve reliable control, in terms of the quality of the CO2 control, with significant simplification of construction and reduced capital cost.},

abstract = {Partitioning the root-derived CO2 efflux from soil (frequently termed rhizosphere respiration) into actual root respiration (RR, respiration by autotrophs) and rhizomicrobial respiration (RMR, respiration by heterotrophs) is crucial in determining the carbon (C) and energy balance of plants and soils. It is also essential in quantifying C sources for rhizosphere microorganisms and in estimation of the C contributing to turnover of soil organic matter (SOM), as well as in linking net ecosystem production (NEP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Artificial-environment studies such as hydroponics or sterile soils yield unrealistic C-partitioning values and are unsuitable for predicting C flows under natural conditions. To date, several methods have been suggested to separate RR and RMR in nonsterile soils: 1) component integration, 2) substrate-induced respiration, 3) respiration by excised roots, 4) comparison of root-derived (CO2)-C-14 with rhizomicrobial (CO2)-C-14 after continuous labeling, 5) isotope dilution, 6) model-rhizodeposition technique, 7) modeling of (CO2)-C-14 efflux dynamics, 8) exudate elution, and 9) delta(13)C of CO2 and microbial biomass. This review describes the basic principles and assumptions of these methods and compares the results obtained in the original papers and in studies designed to compare the methods. The component-integration method leads to strong disturbance and non-proportional increase of CO2 efflux from different sources. Four of the methods (5 to 8) are based on the pulse labeling of shoots in a (CO2)-C-14 atmosphere and subsequent monitoring of (CO2)-C-14 efflux from the soil. The model-rhizodeposition technique and exudate-elution procedure strongly overestimate RR and underestimate RMR. Despite alternative assumptions, isotope dilution and modeling of (CO2)-C-14-efflux dynamics yield similar results. In crops and grasses (wheat, ryegrass, barley, buckwheat, maize, meadow fescue, prairie grasses), RR amounts on average to 48 +/- 5% and RMR to 52 +/- 5% of root-derived CO2. The method based on the C-13 isotopic signature of CO2 and microbial biomass is the most promising approach, especially when the plants are continuously labeled in (CO2)-C-13 or (CO2)-C-14 atmosphere. The ``difference'' methods, i.e., trenching, tree girdling, root-exclusion techniques, etc., are not suitable for separating the respiration by autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms because the difference methods neglect the importance of microbial respiration of rhizodeposits.},

DAYCENT model simulations for miscanthus were parameterized with data from trial plots in Europe and Illinois, USA. Switchgrass, corn, and prairie ecosystems were simulated using parameters published in the literature. A previously unknown source of nitrogen (N) was necessary to balance the plant nutrient budget in miscanthus crops, leading us to hypothesize that miscanthus growth depends on N-fixation. We tested for nitrogenase activity by acetylene reduction of whole rhizomes and bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere and miscanthus tissue. Our results supported the hypothesis that biological N-fixation contributed to the N demand of miscanthus, a highly productive perennial grass. Corn agro-ecosystems emit 956 to 1899 g CO2eq m(-2) y(-1) greater GHGs (including CO2, N2O, CH4) to the atmosphere than the other biofuel crop alternatives because of greater N2O emissions from fertilizer additions.

abstract = {Warming and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) can elicit contrasting responses on different SOM pools, thus to understand the effects of combined factors it is necessary to evaluate individual pools. Over two years, we assessed responses to eCO(2) and warming of SOM pools, their susceptibility to decomposition, and whether these responses were mediated by plant inputs in a semi-arid grassland at the PHACE (Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment) experiment. We used long-term soil incubations and assessed relationships between plant inputs and the responses of the labile and resistant pools. We found strong and contrasting effects of eCO(2) and warming on the labile C pool. In 2008 labile C was increased by eCO(2) and was positively related to plant biomass. In contrast, in 2007 eCO(2) and warming had interactive effects on the labile C, and the pool size was not related to plant biomass. Effects of warming and eCO(2) in this year were consistent with-treatment effects on soil moisture and temperature and their effects on labile C decomposition. The decomposition rate of the resistant C was positively related to indicators of plant C inputs. Our approach demonstrated that SOM pools in this grassland can have early and contrasting responses to climate change factors. The labile C pool in the mixed-grass prairie was highly responsive to eCO(2) and warming but the factors behind such responses were highly dynamic across years. Results suggest that in this grassland the resistant C pool could be negatively affected by increases in plant-production driven available soil C.},

abstract = {The response of soil organic matter (OM) decomposition to increasing temperature is a critical aspect of ecosystem responses to global change. The impacts of climate warming on decomposition dynamics have not been resolved due to apparently contradictory results from field and lab experiments, most of which has focused on labile carbon with short turnover times. But the majority of total soil carbon stocks are comprised of organic carbon with turnover times of decades to centuries. Understanding the response of these carbon pools to climate change is essential for forecasting longer-term changes in soil carbon storage. Herein, we briefly synthesize information from recent studies that have been conducted using a wide variety of approaches. In our effort to understand research to-date, we derive a new conceptual model that explicitly identifies the processes controlling soil OM availability for decomposition and allows a more explicit description of the factors regulating OM decomposition under different circumstances. It explicitly defines resistance of soil OM to decomposition as being due either to its chemical conformation (quality) or its physico-chemical protection from decomposition. The former is embodied in the depolymerization process, the latter by adsorption/desorption and aggregate turnover. We hypothesize a strong role for variation in temperature sensitivity as a function of reaction rates for both. We conclude that important advances in understanding the temperature response of the processes that control substrate availability, depolymerization, microbial efficiency, and enzyme production will be needed to predict the fate of soil carbon stocks in a warmer world.},

abstract = {A common method to determine in situ root respiration is to insert root exclusions to sever roots and then to measure soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux in and outside the exclusion. We report the use of relatively small root exclusions (15.2 cm diameter plastic pipe) (SREs), installed and measured within a growing season. We switched from long-used, large root exclusions (2.5 m x 3 m) (LREs) for three reasons. First, temperature artifacts were apparent in LREs, likely because increased soil moisture altered soil thermal balance. Second, LREs in dense stands required a relatively low tree density, which then impacted snowpack depth and insolation. Third, the LREs were much more time-consuming to install than SREs. Using a powered mechanical trencher (ditch witch((R))) decreased LRE installation time, but introduced a large edge-effect apparent in soil profile pCO(2) that would obviate trenched plots smaller than 1600 cm(2). However, when trenches were dug by hand, the distance from the LRE wall had no effect on soil pCO(2). In a subsequent experiment, SREs were installed by cleanly cutting the forest floor, and then immediately measured. Within 1-3 weeks the SREs provided similar root respiration estimates to those made with LREs that had been in place for nearly 10 months. SREs placed in and outside LREs provided indistinguishable microbial respiration values from one another and to the LREs. We conclude SREs provide root respiration estimates indistinguishable from other methods, even when installed and measured within the same growing season.},

abstract = {Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is predicted to raise the mean global temperature by 1.0-3.5 degreesC in the next 50-100 years. The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or altitude) tundra, low tundra, grassland, and forest. Warming methods included electrical heat-resistance ground cables, greenhouses, vented and unvented field chambers, overhead infrared lamps, and passive nighttime warming. Although results from individual sites showed considerable variation in response to warming, results from the meta-analysis showed that, across all sites and years, 2-9 years of experimental warming in the range 0.3-6.0 degreesC significantly increased soil respiration rates by 20% (with a 95% confidence interval of 18-22%), net N mineralization rates by 46% (with a 95% confidence interval of 30-64%). and plant productivity by 19% (with a 95% confidence interval of 15-23%). The response of soil respiration to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low tundra and grassland ecosystems, and the response of plant productivity was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant productivity, which showed a greater positive response to warming in colder ecosystems, the magnitude of the response of these three processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly related to the geographic, climatic, or environmental variables evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature, moisture, site quality, vegetation type, successional status, land-use history, etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales, and suggests that we should be cautious in "scaling up" responses from the plot and site level to the landscape and biome level. Overall, ecosystem-warming experiments are shown to provide valuable insights on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated temperature.},

abstract = {A land surface submodel was developed for the daily version of the CENTURY ecosystem model (DAYCENT). The goal of DAYCENT to simulate soil N2O, NOx, and CH4 fluxes for terrestrial ecosystems determined the structure and processes represented in the land surface model. The land surface model was set up to simulate daily dynamics of soil water and temperature from a multi-layered soil system (0-1, 1-4, 4-15, 15-30 cm, etc.) and included surface runoff and above field capacity soil water dynamics during intense rainfall events and snowmelt into frozen soils. The comparison of the simulated soil water content (0-10 cm) with observed data from four sites was quite favorable (squared correlation coefficient-gamma(2) = 0.87, 0.65, 0.86 and 0.58) and the simulated results were comparable for the soil temperature model (r(2) = 0.92 and 0.95 for minimum and maximum 10 cm soil temperatures). Detailed soil water and temperature data during snowmelt time periods and following rainfall events are needed to fully evaluate the performance of the water flow model.

abstract = {Conversions of Mollisols from prairie to cropland and subsequent changes in crop production practices in the Midwestern USA have resulted in changes in soil organic matter. Few studies have used archived samples, long-term resampling of soils to a depth of 1 m, and space for time studies to document these changes. We resampled soils by depth (0-100 cm) in fields at 19 locations in central Illinois on poorly drained Mollisols that were in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) rotations, were tile drained, and had no known history of manure application in recent decades. Three fields were paired with virgin prairie remnants, two had grass borders that were sampled, and 16 had been previously sampled in 1901 to 1904 or 1957 under various land uses (virgin prairie, cultivation, grass cover). The soils had large amounts of C and N in the profile, with mean values of 175 [corrected] Mg C ha(-1) and 16.1 Mg N ha(-1) for the 18 cultivated fields sampled in 2001 and 2002. We confirmed a large reduction in organic C and total N pools from conversion of prairies to annual cultivation and artificial drainage and documented no change in these organic matter pools of cultivated soils during the period of synthetic fertilizer use (1957--2002). Cultivated fields had soil C and N concentrations typically 30 to 50% less than virgin prairie soils. Smaller but significant declines in C and N concentrations were found when comparing 1900s cultivated fields to concentrations in 2002, after another 100 yr of cultivation, and in comparing 1957 grass covered fields that had been converted to annual cultivation before 2002. The reduction in organic matter after cultivation of prairies occurred mostly in the top 50 cm of soil, with evidence of translocation of C and N from these upper layers to the 50- to 100-cm depth, possibly enhanced by tile drainage. For these Mollisols, declines in organic matter were likely completed by the 1950s, with organic matter pools in a steady state under the production practices in place from the late 1950s through 2002.},

abstract = {Global warming potentially alters the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, likely feeding back to further climate warming. However, how the ecosystem C cycle responds and feeds back to warming remains unclear. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to quantify the response ratios of 18 variables of the ecosystem C cycle to experimental warming and evaluated ecosystem C-cycle feedback to climate warming. Our results showed that warming stimulated gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) by 15.7%, net primary production (NPP) by 4.4%, and plant C pools from above- and belowground parts by 6.8% and 7.0%, respectively. Experimental warming accelerated litter mass loss by 6.8%, soil respiration by 9.0%, and dissolved organic C leaching by 12.1%. In addition, the responses of some of those variables to experimental warming differed among the ecosystem types. Our results demonstrated that the stimulation of plant-derived C influx basically offset the increase in warming-induced efflux and resulted in insignificant changes i...},

abstract = {The temperature dependence of soil respiration (R-S) is widely used as a key characteristic of soils or organic matter fractions within soils, and in the context of global climatic change is often applied to infer likely responses of R-S to warmer future conditions. However, the way in which these temperature dependencies are calculated, interpreted and implemented in ecosystem models requires careful consideration of possible artefacts and assumptions. We argue that more conceptual clarity in the reported relationships is needed to obtain meaningful meta-analyses and better constrained parameters informing ecosystem models. Our critical assessment of common methodologies shows that it is impossible to measure actual temperature response of R-S, and that a range of confounding effects creates the observed apparent temperature relations reported in the literature. Thus, any measureable temperature response function will likely fail to predict effects of climate change on R-S. For improving our understanding of R-S in changing environments we need a better integration of the relationships between substrate supply and the soil biota, and of their long-term responses to changes in abiotic soil conditions. This is best achieved by experiments combining isotopic techniques and ecosystem manipulations, which allow a disentangling of abiotic and biotic factors underlying the temperature response of soil CO2 efflux.

abstract = {The earth's future climate state is highly dependent upon changes in terrestrial C storage in response to rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Experiments to date display a wide range of productivity responses to elevated CO2, yet the mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes is insufficient to account for the observed variation. Here we detail the processes controlling the sustained productivity response of a warm-temperate forest to 12 years of continuous atmospheric CO2 enrichment. We show that enhanced rates of net primary production (NPP) under elevated CO2 are sustained by a C-cascade through the root-microbe-soil system; increases in the flux of C belowground under elevated CO2 stimulated microbial activity, accelerated the rate of soil organic matter decomposition, and stimulated tree uptake of N bound to this SOM. This process set into motion a positive feedback maintaining greater C gain under elevated CO2 as a result of increases in canopy N content and higher photosynthetic N-use efficiency. An emergent, ecosystem-level property of the interaction between the enhanced
requirement for N and belowground exchanges of plant C for N is the storage of C in tree biomass but the preclusion of C accumulation in the soil. Comparisons of the responses reported here to those in the published literature suggest that long-term productivity responses to elevated CO2 in N limited ecosystems may be facilitated by plant associations with ectomycorrhizal fungi, a group of soil microbes known to decompose a wide range of soil organic material and transfer N to host plants.},

abstract = {The Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment has been initiated at a site in southern Wyoming (USA) to simulate the impact of warming and elevated atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem dynamics for semiarid grassland ecosystems. The daycent ecosystem model was parametrized to simulate the impact of elevated CO2 at the open-top chamber (OTC) experiment in north-eastern Colorado (199620132001), and was also used to simulate the projected ecosystem impact of the PHACE experiments during the next 10 yr. Model results suggest that soil water content, plant production, soil respiration, and nutrient mineralization will increase for the high-CO2 treatment. Soil water content will decrease for all years, while nitrogen mineralization, soil respiration, and plant production will both decrease and increase under warming depending on yearly differences in water stress. Net primary production (NPP) will be greatest under combined warming and elevated CO2 during wet years. Model results are consistent with empirical field data suggesting that water and nitrogen will be critical drivers of the semiarid grassland response to global change.

abstract = {Forest soil respiration is the sum of heterotrophic (microbes, soil fauna) and autotrophic (root) respiration. The contribution of each group needs to be understood to evaluate implications of environmental change on soil carbon cycling and sequestration. Three primary methods have been used to distinguish hetero- versus autotrophic soil respiration including: integration of components contributing to in situ forest soil CO2 efflux (i.e., litter, roots, soil), comparison of soils with and without root exclusion, and application of stable or radioactive isotope methods. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, but isotope based methods provide quantitative answers with the least amount of disturbance to the soil and roots. Published data from all methods indicate that root/rhizosphere respiration can account for as little as 10 percent to greater than 90 percent of total in situ soil respiration depending on vegetation type and season of the year. Studies which have integrated percent root contribution to total soil respiration throughout an entire year or growing season show mean values of 45.8 and 60.4 percent for forest and nonforest vegetation, respectively. Such average annual values must be extrapolated with caution, however, because the root contribution to total soil respiration is commonly higher during the growing season and lower during the dormant periods of the year.},

abstract = {The shortgrass steppe is a semi-arid grassland, where elevated CO2 reduces stomatal conductance and promotes soil moisture storage. Enhanced biomass growth from elevated CO2 has been attributed in part to soil moisture effects. However, the influence of this soil moisture feedback on C cycling has received little attention. We used open-top chambers to increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations to twice-ambient for four growing seasons. Soil respiration rates and stable C isotopes of soil CO2 were measured during the third and fourth seasons. Elevated CO2 increased soil respiration rates by similar to25% in a moist growing season and by similar to85% in a dry season. Stable C isotope partitioning of soil respiration into its components of decomposition and rhizosphere respiration was facilitated on all treatments by a C-13 disequilibrium between currently growing plants and soil organic matter. Decomposition rates were more than doubled by elevated CO2, whereas rhizosphere respiration rates were not changed. In general, decomposition rates were most significantly correlated with soil temperature, and rhizosphere respiration rates were best predicted by soil moisture content. Model simulations suggested that soil moisture feedbacks, rather than differences in substrate availability, were primarily responsible for higher total respiration rates under elevated CO2. By contrast, modeling demonstrated that substrate availability was at least as important as soil moisture in driving CO2 treatment differences in soil organic matter decomposition rates.},
