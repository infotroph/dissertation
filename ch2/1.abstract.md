## Abstract

Warming temperatures and increasing CO~2~ are likely to have large effects on the amount of carbon stored in soil, but predictions of these effects are poorly constrained. We elevated temperature (canopy: +2.8 °C; soil growing season: +1.8 °C; soil fallow: +2.3 °C) for three years within the 9th-11th years of an elevated CO~2~ (+200 ppm) experiment on a maize-soybean agroecosystem, measured respiration by roots and soil microbes, then used a process-based ecosystem model (DayCent) to simulate the decadal effects of warming and CO~2~ enrichment on soil C.
Both heating and elevated CO~2~ increased respiration from soil microbes by ~20%, but heating reduced respiration from roots and rhizosphere by ~25%. The effects were additive, with no heat x CO~2~ interactions. Particulate organic matter and total soil C declined over time in all treatments and were lower in elevated CO~2~ plots than in ambient plots, but did not differ between heat treatments. We speculate that these declines indicate a priming effect, with increased C inputs under elevated CO~2~ fueling a loss of old soil carbon.
Model simulations of heated plots agreed with our observations and predicted loss of ~15% of soil organic C after 100 years of heating, but simulations of elevated CO~2~ failed to predict the observed C losses and instead predicted a ~4% gain in soil organic C under any heating conditions. Despite model uncertainty, our empirical results suggest that combined, elevated CO~2~ and temperature will lead to long term declines in the amount of carbon stored in agricultural soils.
