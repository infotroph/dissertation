Notes from compiling pre-defense version:

tface paper:
* Copied from Word version, pasted
* Turned off line numbers
* header styles seem to have updated automatically
* Refs to supp figs/tables were broken "((???))" in version I copied from -- oh yeah, I originally compiled this with a hacked pandoc-crossref. Fixed by hand in diss file, did not fix in tface paper file.
* Table 1 footnote to compact, add newline
* All figure styles to compact, adjust size to fit on page w/caption
* Add table/figure numbers to supplements
* Remove broken crossref tags from supp tables, adjust column widths, set footnotes to compact


efrhizo paper
* copied from Word, pasted
* turned off line numbers
* deleted keywords
* Adusted figures sizes

prairie paper
*opened, transferred EHD edits to Markdown accepting as I went
* copied into diss document
* turned off line nums
* that's pretty much it! hand-fixed a typo or two here and in Makrdown, but figs all ~ok

todo:
	update NASS citation? looks weird to say "in 2016, 71.3 million acres... (NASS 2011)."


For version submitted morning of 20161129:

Compiled each chapter in its original manuscript directory, in a newly created branch named 'as-diss-chap' (ch. 2) or 'as-diss-chapter' (chapters 3,4). For all chapters, edited Makefile to point to versions of style/filter files in     /UI/dissertation and tweaked various formats/text to match dissertation style as closely as possible. See each chapter's repo for details... Basically I copied in a lot of "fully formatted" text and then tweaked format, and in many cases content too, a lot in Word. No, sorry, I don't have a better record than that.

Title page: Assembled by hand in Word.

Abstract, Acknowledgements, Ch5/Conclusions: Compiled by `$(make -f endmatter.make)`, copied & pasted from each compiled docx into ckb_dissertation.docx, no further changes.

Table of Contents: Assembled by hand in Word, must update page numbers every edit.

* Ch1/intro: 
    - Compiled by endmatter.make
    - copied & pasted
    - Added newlines before each section header, except when header is already at the top of a page
    - Added section break between end of refs and beginning of Ch. 2
  	- Reset page numbers: open header & footer ribbon tab, uncheck "link to previous", open Insert > Page Numbers > Format > "restart at" > 1.

* Ch2/TFACE: 
	- Opened version compiled and hand-edited as `drafts_to_evan/ckb-tface-20161127_dissformatted.docx` in 'as-diss-chap' branch of TFACE repo, selected all.
	- Pasted
	- Removed linebreaks above section headers when they were already at top of page
	- Hand-corrected citations Not a complete check, just the ones I noticed. NOT corrected in any upstream source:
		David et al 2009: journal name "Environment"->"Environmental"
		Jelinski and Kucharik 2009 journal name "Of"->"of"
		Eswaran et al 1993 journal name "Of"->"of"
		Healy et al 1996 journal name "Of"->"of"
		Marriott and Wander 2006  journal name "Of"->"of"
		Pendall et al 2013 journal name "Plos One" -> "PLoS ONE"
	- updated TOC entry: Ch2 now begins on P. 12.

* Ch3/rhizotron:
	- Updated TOC entry: Now begins on P. 62.
	- Text not updated yet; waiting for EHD edits.

* Hand-edits after pasting all sections together included: 
    - reset margins to 1" everywhere (Some chapters compile at 1.25" -- even though all use the same style files!)
    - Adjusted newlines before headers to compensate for repagination after margin change
    - resized all images to 6.5" wide, unless they needed to be smaller to fit caption on page
    - Fiddled with table column widths
    - Probably other changes I'm forgetting

        - Removed "Supplement" and numbers from section headers.
        - Added "References" section header after figures
        - Populated from Ch. 3 references: *cut* Gelman 2006 (only cited in appendix), *copied* Bragg et al, Samson and Sinclair, Ephrath.
        - Searched for "3.S" in whole document, replaced with "B."

    * Updated chapter starting page numbers in table of contents
    * Added appendices to table of contents

Note that none of the renumberings from "supplement" to "appendix" have been propagated back to any file other than CK_Black_dissertation_20161129_v2.docx and CK_Black_dissertation_20161129_v2.pdf, and they probably never will be.
