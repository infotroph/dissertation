abstract = {Minirhizotrons provide a nondestructive, in situ method for directly viewing and studying fine roots. Although many insights into fine roots have been gained using minirhizotrons, a review of the literature indicates a wide variation in how minirhizotrons and minirhizotron data are used. Tube installation is critical, and steps must be taken to insure good soil/tube contact without compacting the soil. Ideally, soil adjacent to minirhizotrons a ill mimic bulk soil. Tube installation causes some degree of soil disturbance and has the potential to create artifacts in subsequent root data and analysis. We therefore recommend a waiting period between tube installation and image collection of 6-12 months to allow roots to recolonize the space around the tubes and to permit nutrients to return to pre-disturbance levels. To make repeated observations of individual roots for the purposes of quantifying their dynamic properties (e.g. root production, turnover or lifespan), tubes should be secured to prevent movement. The frequency of image collection depends upon the root parameters being measured or calculated and the time and resources available for collecting images and extracting data. However, long sampling intervals of 8 weeks or more can result in large underestimates of root dynamic properties because more fine roots will be born and die unobserved between sampling events. A sampling interval of 2 weeks or less reduces these underestimates to acceptable levels. While short sample intervals are desirable, they can lead to a potential trade-off between the number of minirhizotron tubes used and the number of frames analyzed per tube. Analyzing fewer frames per minirhizotron tube is one way to reduce costs with only miner effects on data variation. The quality of minirhizotron data should be assessed and reported; procedures for quantifying the quality of minirhizotron data are presented here. Root length is a more sensitive metric for dynamic root properties than the root number. To make minirhizotron data from separate experiments more easily comparable, idiosyncratic units should be avoided. Volumetric units compatible with aboveground plant measures make minirhizotron-based estimates of root standing crop, production and turnover more useful. Methods for calculating the volumetric root data are discussed and an example presented. Procedures for estimating fine root lifespan are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Conversions of Mollisols from prairie to cropland and subsequent changes in crop production practices in the Midwestern USA have resulted in changes in soil organic matter. Few studies have used archived samples, long-term resampling of soils to a depth of 1 m, and space for time studies to document these changes. We resampled soils by depth (0-100 cm) in fields at 19 locations in central Illinois on poorly drained Mollisols that were in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) rotations, were tile drained, and had no known history of manure application in recent decades. Three fields were paired with virgin prairie remnants, two had grass borders that were sampled, and 16 had been previously sampled in 1901 to 1904 or 1957 under various land uses (virgin prairie, cultivation, grass cover). The soils had large amounts of C and N in the profile, with mean values of 175 [corrected] Mg C ha(-1) and 16.1 Mg N ha(-1) for the 18 cultivated fields sampled in 2001 and 2002. We confirmed a large reduction in organic C and total N pools from conversion of prairies to annual cultivation and artificial drainage and documented no change in these organic matter pools of cultivated soils during the period of synthetic fertilizer use (1957--2002). Cultivated fields had soil C and N concentrations typically 30 to 50% less than virgin prairie soils. Smaller but significant declines in C and N concentrations were found when comparing 1900s cultivated fields to concentrations in 2002, after another 100 yr of cultivation, and in comparing 1957 grass covered fields that had been converted to annual cultivation before 2002. The reduction in organic matter after cultivation of prairies occurred mostly in the top 50 cm of soil, with evidence of translocation of C and N from these upper layers to the 50- to 100-cm depth, possibly enhanced by tile drainage. For these Mollisols, declines in organic matter were likely completed by the 1950s, with organic matter pools in a steady state under the production practices in place from the late 1950s through 2002.},

abstract = {Replacing annual row crops with perennial grasses for bioenergy represents a landscape-level change in species composition, with the potential to impact annual soil nutrient removal on a regional scale. In this study we measured the concentration of ten essential nutrients in harvested material from three potential perennial bioenergy crops: Panicum virgatum L., Miscanthus giganteus, and a reestablished prairie to determine annual soil nutrient removals. We compared perennial bioenergy crops to nutrient removals by annual cropping systems of Zea mays L. (maize) and Glycine max L. (soybean) in Illinois. Crops were grown under management practices typical for the Midwest, US. In addition, we examined geographic variation in nutrient removal of M. giganteus at four US locations. Total removal of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Na, and Zn was significantly greater in maize than in any of the perennials. Removal of N, P, and K in M. giganteus was 3.7, 1.8, and 1.8% of the removal in maize, and 49.0, 17.4, and 31.9% of the removal in soybean respectively. At sites in Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, and New Jersey we found differences in N and K removal by M. giganteus that corresponded with differences in biomass. There was no effect of fertilization on M. giganteus biomass, but removal of N, S, and Mg increased and P removal decreased with increasing rates of urea fertilization. Cultivation of M. giganteus and switchgrass on land formerly used for row crops may reduce the need for nutrient additions and potential losses of nutrients to groundwater and the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The minirhiozotron (MR) root observation method was studied versus root length density (RLD) obtained from soil cores. Two plant species, acacia (Acacia saligna) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown in a 1-m(3) container on Silt Loam (Typic Torrifluvent) and on fine dune sand (Typic Torripsamment), respectively. Roots of both plants were measured periodically by the two methods. The MR observation tubes (MROT) were inserted, either vertically or at 45 degrees. The correlation between the number of roots obtained by the MR and RLD was significant for the entire profile. However, an appreciable error in root estimation by the MR root observation method at the upper 10-cm soil might occur. No significant difference was obtained from MROT oriented vertically or at 45 degrees. The differences between the correlation coefficients of the two methods were not significant, for both plants and soils, indicating that this correlation expresses the geometry of the two measurement systems, not affected by plant or soil types. We concluded that the MR method may be used as an in situ, non-destructive root measuring method with reasonable confidence.},

abstract = {We measured carbon (C) stocks and fluxes and vegetation phenology in the world's oldest prairie restoration (similar to 65 years) and an adjacent prairie remnant in southern Wisconsin from 2001-2004 to quantify structural and functional differences. While the species distributions and frequency differed, the number of species measured per 1 m(2) quadrat were not significantly different (15.8 +/- 4.4 and 14.1 +/- 2.1 for remnant and planted [order for all reported values in abstract]; P=0.29), and the annual average aboveground net primary productivity (271 +/- 51 and 330 +/- 55 g C m(-2)) and peak leaf area index (2.9-4.9 m(2) m(-2)) were comparable under similar fire management. Total root biomass was not significantly different in 2002 (1736 +/- 1062 and 1690 +/- 459 g dry matter m(-2)) or 2003 (3029 +/- 2081 and 2146 +/- 898 g m(-2)), but annual average soil respiration (1229 +/- 77 and 1428 +/- 24 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) was significantly higher in the restoration (P < 0.0001). However, the prairie remnant contained 37% greater soil C (P < 0.0001) in the top 25 cm. Soil respiration response to 10 cm soil temperature (Q(10)) varied with respect to prairie and soil moisture conditions as annual Q(10) values ranged from 2.5 to 3.6. We calculated a range of net ecosystem production (NEP) values using estimated heterotrophic respiration and three root turnover values. Average NEP varied from -1.4 to 1.9 and -2.3 to 1.3 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) for the remnant and planted prairies, respectively. While these two prairies share similar structural components and functional attributes, the large uncertainty in NEP casts doubt as to whether we can verify these prairies as C sources or sinks without direct measures of heterotrophic respiration and root turnover. We argue that quantitative studies of C exchange in prairies, which differ in restoration methodology, management intensity, and fire frequency, are needed to solidify the relationship between prairie structure and potentially desired functions such as C sequestration.},

abstract = {The recovery of ecosystem C and N dynamics after disturbance can be a slow process. Chronosequence approaches offer unique opportunities to use space-for-time substitution to quantify the recovery of ecosystem C and N stocks and estimate the potential of restoration practices for C sequestration. We studied the distribution of C and N stocks in two chronosequences that included long-term cultivated lands, 3- to 26-year-old prairie restorations, and remnant prairie on two related soil series. Results from the two chronosequences did not vary significantly and were combined. Based on modeling predictions, the recovery rates of different ecosystem components varied greatly. Overall, C stocks recovered faster than N stocks, but both C and N stocks recovered more rapidly for aboveground vegetation than for any other ecosystem component. Aboveground C and N reached 95% of remnant levels in only 13 years and 21 years, respectively, after planting to native vegetation. Belowground plant C and N recovered several decades later, while microbial biomass C, soil organic C (SOC), and total soil N recovered on a century timescale. In the cultivated fields, SOC concentrations were depleted within the surface 25 cm, coinciding with the depth of plowing, but cultivation apparently led to redistribution of soil C, increasing SOC stocks deeper in the soil profile. The restoration of prairie vegetation was effective at rebuilding soil organic matter (SOM) in the surface soil. Accrual rates were maintained at 43 g C x m(-2) x yr(-1) and 3 g N x m(-2) x yr(-1) in the surface 0.16 Mg/m2 soil mass during the first 26 years of restoration and were predicted to reach 50% of their storage potential (3500 g C/m2) in the first 100 years. We conclude that restoration of tallgrass prairie vegetation can restore SOM lost through cultivation and has the potential to sequester relatively large amounts of SOC over a sustained period of time. Whether restored prairies can retain the C apparently transferred to the subsoil by cultivation practices remains to be seen.},

abstract = {Rhizotrons provide valuable information about plant root production, but measurements are usually made in units of root length per unit surface area of observation window surface. These measurement units are not easily comparable to above-ground plant growth. To address this deficiency, several techniques have been developed to convert rhizotron measurement units into root mass production per unit ground area. In this study, four different conversion methods were applied to the same dataset of rhizotron measurements. This data was used to reveal the effect of conversion method upon estimates of the temporal variation in, and annual magnitude of, gross root mass production. Application of four different conversion methods resulted in gross root production estimates ranging between 2.1 and 11.4 t ha(-1) year(-1). Temporal variation in gross root mass production also varied between methods. All current methods for quantifying root production are likely to cause some disturbance and bias. Based upon a comparison of the sources of error present in each conversion method, we assess which methods are likely to produce the most reliable estimates of root biomass production per unit ground area, and propose additional measurements which could further improve accuracy.},

abstract = {This study focused on root size and distribution of energy crops which may be a reliable indicator of the capability of these crops to accumulate significant C stocks in the soil. Alike, understanding root size and distribution may provide new insights into the knowledge of mechanisms involved in soil water uptake. The present research was performed in North Italy, Po Valley (32ma.s.l., 44 degrees 33'N, 11 degrees 21'E). The assessment of root distribution and biomass of Panicum virgatum (switchgrass = S), Miscanthus x giganteus (miscanthus = M), Arundo donax (giant reed = G) and Sorghum bicolor (fibre sorghum = FS), in a soil profile of 1.2 m depth, aimed at providing new insights into carbon storage and water capture capacity. Despite a similar above ground biomass production, perennial crops exhibited different total root biomass, root shape and water uptake. G accumulated considerably higher total root biomass (13.6 Mg ha(-1), d.w. basis), while FS, being annual, produced clearly the lowest root biomass (2.1 Mg ha(-1)). Root biomass distribution was described using the beta model, through the relationships between root length density (RLD) and soil depth. In summary, M had a very superficial root shape (beta = 0.931) with almost 90% of total root biomass concentrated in the top 0.35 m soil, while G and S exhibited a relative even root distribution (beta = 0.979 and 0.984, respectively). RLD and root weight showed diverse patterns among crops and along the soil profile due to different root diameters and root bulk densities of the crops. Root water capture capacity (phi) was determined according to the King model through the relationship between soil moisture and RLD in vertically succeeding soil layers. Differences in phi among crops were expressed through the constant k, which resumes many physiological and environmental details driving water uptake. Briefly, high k means a faster water uptake for a given RLD. M showed the highest k (2.50) followed by FS (1.02), G (0.54) and S (0.31). Importantly, k and beta were closely and negatively related which would mean that top-rooted crops, though being more subjected to drought risks, have significant higher abilities in recovering soil water. This is an assertion which is consistent with the previous studies that showed M being highly productive under wet environment, but very sensitive to water shortage. This study shows that energy crops can greatly differ in terms of water capture and root distribution, a fact that should be taken into great account in optimizing the land use change.

abstract = {Many methods are used to study plant root system development and function. Most methods are tedious and time-consuming. Some require expensive, sophisticated equipment and frequently require highly trained operators. Few studies are published where several methods are compared for their time requirements, equipment needs, soil applicability, and validity of the results. This study determined usefulness of five methods for characterizing soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rooting depth and density in a loess $[$fine, silty, mixed (calcareous) mesic family of Typic Udorthents$]$ soil. The methods were: (a) soil water-depletion, (b) framed-monolith and pinboard, (c) core-sampling, (d) mini-rhizotron, and (e) trench-profile. Each method was used or attempted on several dates during the 1975 growing season. The soil water-depletion method was fast, required only simple equipment, and provided satisfactory estimates of rooting depth but did not provide reliable estimates of rooting density. The framed-monolith method was very time-consuming, but provided quantitative estimates of rooting density with depth and could have provided rooting density estimates with distance from the row. The core-sampling method was faster than the framed-monolith method. Cores could he obtained either with a hand-turned bucket auger or with a coring machine, but several profiles were required to obtain rooting density distributions with depth and distance from the row. The mini-rhizotron method was fast, but did not provide accurate results, presumably because the mini-rhizotrons were installed too late. The trench-profile method provided semiquantitative estimates of rooting density with depth and distance from the row. The trench-profile method was rapid and required no time-consuming separation of live roots from debris of previous years. The hand-augered core, soil water-depletion, and the trench-profile methods could be used through the entire growing season, but the framed-monolith and the mechanized-core methods were not satisfactory during a drought period because the soil column collapsed during sampling.},

abstract = {We lack a thorough conceptual and functional understanding of fine roots. Studies that have focused on estimating the quantity of fine roots provide evidence that they dominate overall plant root length. We need a standard procedure to quantify root length/biomass that takes proper account of fine roots. Here we investigated the extent to which root length/biomass may be underestimated using conventional methodology, and examined the technical reasons that could explain such underestimation. Our discussion is based on original X-ray-based measurements and on a literature review spanning more than six decades. We present evidence that root-length recovery depends strongly on the observation scale/spatial resolution at which measurements are carried out; and that observation scales/resolutions adequate for fine root detection have an adverse impact on the processing times required to obtain precise estimates. We conclude that fine roots are the major component of root systems of most (if not all) annual and perennial plants. Hence plant root systems could be much longer, and probably include more biomass, than is widely accepted.},

abstract = {Estimating root production has been difficult due to multiple potential biases associated with both old and new methods. This shortgrass steppe site is the only place we are aware of that can compare most methods including sequential coring, ingrowth cores, and ingrowth donuts, C-14 pulse-isotope dilution, C-14 pulse-isotope turnover, rhizotron windows, and minirhizotron, and indirect methods including nitrogen budget, carbon flux, simulation carbon flow model, and regression model. We used the studies at this site, other comparisons, a summary of potential directional biases, and different ways of calculating estimates in a logical, comparative approach of evaluating methods. Much of the literature for root production is based on sequential biomass coring, a method resulting in erroneous estimates. Root ingrowth estimates of production are generally conservative compared to minirhizotron and isotope turnover methods. The size of the ingrowth area may be the most important determinant of the underestimation. Estimates based on pulse-isotope dilution are also erroneous due to non-uniform labeling of tissues. Uniform labeling is not an assumption of the pulse-isotope turnover method, and this method has the least severe potential biases. Root production estimates from pulse-isotope turnover were lower than those using minirhizotron when the most common method of calculation was used. This agrees with literature concerning bomb C-14 continuous-isotope labeling comparisons with minirhizotron, although some potential biases between isotope methods are different. However, good agreement between pulse-isotope turnover and minirhizotron were obtained when minirhizotron estimates were calculated from regression of decomposition versus production to equilibrium and when pulse-isotope turnover estimates were calculated from two-phase life-span regressions. This minirhizotron method bypasses biases associated with the artificial surface similar to root-cohort methods that may be practical only in mesic systems, and takes into account both short- and long-lived roots and corrects for soil-isotope contamination that the continuous-isotope labeling bomb C-14 method is not able to account for. Comparisons of these direct methods are also made with four indirect methods.},
