## Abstract

Root architecture is a key driver of plant ecology and physiology, but our current understanding of root placement in the soil profile is limited and biased by current detection methods. To better characterize the root placement and carbon-storage potential of land-use changes from conventional agriculture to perennial grass biofuels, we developed a statistical model to allow robust depth- and time-resolved measurements of standing root volume from minirhizotron images. By correcting for small sample sizes and near-surface underdetection effects, our Bayesian model explained 30% of the variation in observed root length and validated well against root mass from paired core samples. In their seventh growing season, all three perennial grasses (*Miscanthus* $\times$ *giganteus*, *Panicum virgatum*, and a community of 28 tallgrass prairie species) had 11-16 times more belowground biomass in total, and 2-17 times more mass at every individual depth from 0 to 128 cm, than annually tilled maize and soybean. Perennial crops showed little change in the proportion of root volume allocated to each soil layer through time, but total root volume increased through the five years of the experiment and appeared resilient to a historically hot and dry summer in 2012, suggesting that large-deep root systems helped these crops resist drought. Because the root systems produced by these grasses are large, deep, and persistent, conversion from row crops to perennial biofuel grasses is likely to sequester carbon in a large and potentially very stable soil pool.
