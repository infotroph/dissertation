![Observations versus predictions of visible root volume in individual minirhizotron images. Bars show prediction intervals (grey: 90%; blue: 50%), for newly observed images at the same location. The points along the bottom of the image indicate model predictions for images with zero observed roots and are not included in the regression.](figures/stanfit-obsvspred.png){#fig:muobsregress}

![Model parameter estimates. The grey bar at the left edge of each panel shows the mean ± 95% credible interval of the prior distribution; black bars show posterior mean ± 95% credible interval for each sample day.](figures/stanfit-params.png){#fig:paramci}

![Comparison between root mass measured from soil cores and estimated from minirhizotron images taken in midsummer 2011 and 2014. Each point shows the mean ± 95% interval for one depth layer (0-10, 10-30, 30-50, 50-100 cm) in one experimental plot. Dashed lines show the expected relationship between root mass and volume assuming a 0.78 mm depth of view and constant root tissue densities of 0.08 (maize), 0.20 (*Miscanthus*), 0.19 (switchgrass), or 0.15 (prairie) g cm^-3^.](figures/stan-vs-cores.png){#fig:stanvscore}
