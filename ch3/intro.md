## Introduction

The placement of plant roots in the soil profile is an ecological trait that affects many ecosystem properties. Deeper roots provide structural support, give access to deep water and nutrient pools [@Wasson:2012bk; @Zwicke:2015be], and store carbon [@DeDeyn:2008hv]. Meanwhile shallower roots are less costly, give access to larger but potentially less reliable water and nutrient pools [@Lynch:2001ea; @Hodge:2004ie; @Nippert:2012fd], and promote competitive success through root-zone exclusion [@Genney:2002ja]. The existence of mycorrhizal associations lead to further tradeoffs between root architectures optimized for soil exploration by the root itself or by the mycorrhizal symbiont [@Comas:2009fa; @Liu:2015kl]. Understanding root distributions is therefore fundamental to predicting ecosystem functioning [@Bardgett:2014jl] and improving management outcomes [@Kochian:2016ju].

For the present study, we quantified root distribution in the context of evaluating the ecosystem-level effects on soil C cycling of a change in land use from annual row-crop agriculture to perennial grasses managed for biofuel production. Some researchers have suggested that biofuel grasses may build soil C because of their large root systems and minimal tillage requirements [@AndersonTeixeira:2013bx; @McCalmont:2015dt; @Agostini:2015gb], and some have further proposed that any C gains from biofuel grasses may be especially persistent because of preferential allocation to deep soil and consequent slower turnover [@Balesdent:1996jn; @Rasse:2005ez; @Rumpel:2010ek; @Kell:2011gw; @Agostini:2015gb; @Prieto:2016jm; @Ward:2016fk]. However, to evaluate this claim we need a better idea how much C is added, where it is distributed in the soil, and its turnover time [@Agostini:2015gb].

Understanding of root distributions is much less detailed than our understanding of aboveground traits. This lack of detail is exacerbated by notable drawbacks in the available methods of quantifying root systems [@pierret:2005kb; @Milchunas:2009p3005; @Topp:2016gy]. Pot effects mean container studies are only realistic for very small plants [@Poorter:2012bn]. Destructive approaches such as coring and trenching give accurate snapshots, but require massive effort [hours to days per sample; @bohm:1977eq] and cannot be repeated through time. Furthermore, because the effort required for coring and trenching increases rapidly with depth, many such surveys have focused only on the shallow soil layers (typically 30 cm or less), often leading to severe underestimates of deep root mass [@Mokany:2006ip]. Imaging systems such as minirhizotrons give time-resolved data, but with the tradeoff that the data are noisier and indirect; the raw data are two-dimensional images that must be converted to a three-dimensional volume estimate and then converted again from a volume to a mass, with further possible noise and biases in the conversion [@Metcalfe:2007gv; @Taylor:2013kg].

Minirhizotron observations of standing root mass seem to be especially susceptible to depth biases; previous workers have often reported that minirhizotrons underdetected roots in the shallowest soil layers, probably because of movement of either the tube or the soil leading to poor contact between tube and soil in the least compacted and most frequently disturbed surface horizons [@bragg:1983pi; @taylor:1990gf; @Samson:1994gp; @Parker:1991cs; @Ephrath:1999vq]. Most previous workers who considered this bias have discarded data from the affected layers [potentially containing the majority of the root system; @Samson:1994gp], used paired comparisons within layers, or equivalently developed depth-specific calibration factors. None of these approaches were satisfactory for us because we wanted to compare both total root volume and the fraction of roots found in a given layer over time and among species.

In this study, we tracked the change in root volume associated with a change in management from annually tilled conventional row crops (maize and soybean) to untilled perennial grasses mowed annually for biofuel feedstock. We used minirhizotrons to track seasonal and interannual patterns in root distribution to a depth of >1 m, developed a statistical model to account for biases from underdetection and small samples, and verified our estimates with deep-soil core samples. We predicted that root volume under perennial grasses would be much higher than under row crops, that the root growth season would be longer, and that root systems would reach their maximum extents in the same year each crop achieved maturity as measured by aboveground yields.
