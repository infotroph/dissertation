# Acknowledgements

If I spoke to you between 2009 and 2016, you helped me finish this project; either by letting me talk carbon at you or by forcing me to take a break from talking about carbon. Thank you all! And I am especially grateful for consistent, dedicated help from: 

My advisor, Evan DeLucia, and my committee: Sarah Davis, Carl Bernacchi, Andrew Leakey, and Mark David, for advice, encouragement, and telling me when I was wrong.
Coauthors Tara Hudiburg, Michael Masters, David LeBauer, Krista Anderson-Teixeira, Scott Woolbright, Taylor Pederson, and Christopher Sligar, for their contributions at every stage from experimental design through tedious lab/fieldwork to copyediting.

The IGB and Plant Biology staff, especially Melinda LaBorg, Rayme Dorsey, Lisa Boise, Connie Wilder, and Jana Lenz. If there is a single deadline I didn’t miss on my way to the degree, it is to their credit rather than mine.
The Plant Biology Association of Graduate Students and the DeLucia lab, for fellowship, celebration, commiseration, and for watering my desk plants while I was gone for months.

Programming and statistics mentors Michael Dietze, Jenny Bryan, Charlie Loyd, Nick Blanchard-Wright, Sam Kimbrel, Baptiste Auguié, and an exceptionally helpful user of the Freenode #r channel who I know only as “MrFlick.” If this crew could teach me Git and vector math, they can teach anyone anything.

My wife, Laurel Brehm, for leading the way. It’s official now: You will always have more degrees than me.
